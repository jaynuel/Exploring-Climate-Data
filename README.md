# Exploring-Climate-Data

# Introduction
Climate change poses a great risk to humanity. 
Climate change poses a greater risk to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). 
Between 1970 and 2019, 79% of natural disasters worldwide involved weather and climate related hazards. 
Scientists have high confidence that the global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to the greenhouse gases produced by human activity.

# Research Questions
How are global temperatures affecting the weather and safety of our planet? This question can be broken down into the following sub questions:
What are the trends in global surface temperature?
How do global temperature trends affect glaciers?
How do global temperature trends affect the number of deaths by natural disasters?

# Results and Conclusions 

1. What are the trends in global surface temperature?
Steady increase from 1986 to 2017
Steep incline from 1980 onwards

2. How do global temperature trends affect glacier?
Strong negative correlation
Fits with what we expect from the increasing surface temperature
The Arctic region is the most affected by this

3. How do global temperature trends affect the number of deaths by natural disasters?
Weak negative correlation
Few sharp peaks
