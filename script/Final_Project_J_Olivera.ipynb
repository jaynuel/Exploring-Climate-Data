    "Climate change poses a greater risk to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). They are least able to recover from climate stresses and their economic growth is highly dependent on climate-sensitive sectors.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 1970 and 2019, 79% of natural disasters worldwide involved weather and climate related hazards. It is expected that climate change will threaten years of development progress and increase the number of people living in poverty, adding as many as 122 million more people by 2030. \n",

From the satellite's point of view, it is what it sees when it looks at the ground through the atmosphere. There is a difference between land an air surface temperature. Here, an anomaly can be defined as an instance when conditions depart from the average conditions of a particular place at a given time of the year. For our dataset, the anomaly values are given with a country and a year.  Surface temperature anomalies are very insightful for learning about weather patterns, environmental changes, and global warming, among others."

The storm also brought winds of around 240 km/h (150 mph).

It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 9.1–9.3 Mw, reaching a Mercalli intensity up to IX in certain areas.

This graph shows a steady increase in the global surface temperature over time and a steady decrease in glacier mass balance. Both have a correlation value of **-0.86**. This suggests that there is a strong negative relationship between the surface temperature anomaly and the glacier mass. This kind of relationship was expected. It is interesting to notice that when the temperature anomaly started steeply increasing, around 1990, the glacier mass balance also starts to steeply decrease."

This graph shows a steady increase in the global surface temperature over time and a few strong peaks of deaths amongst a relatively consistent number of deaths. The correlation value between both of these variables is -0.03. This suggests that there is a weak negative relationship between the surface temperature anomaly and the number of death by natural disasters. It is interesting to notice some of the temperature peaks somewhat correlate with the natureal disasters, but not exactly. It is important to keep in mind that the weak negative correlation between the variables does not indication that there is no secondary relationship at all. Correlation does not imply causation after all."
